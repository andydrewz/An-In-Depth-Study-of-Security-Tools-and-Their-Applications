# An-In-Depth-Study-of-Security-Tools-and-Their-Applications

EMAIL FILTERING TOOL: 
An email filtering tool is designed to protect an organization's email system by blocking spam, malware, and phishing attempts, ensuring secure communication. It enhances security by providing advanced threat protection, encrypting sensitive emails, and preventing data leaks.
-	Trend Micro Email Security: stops more phishing, ransomware, and BEC attacks
-	Barracuda Email Security: Protect your users and business from volumetric threats, such as malware and spam.

VULNERABILITY SCANNING TOOL:
The purpose of a vulnerability scanning tool is to identify and assess security weaknesses in an organization's IT infrastructure, such as systems, networks, and applications. By regularly scanning for vulnerabilities, these tools help detect potential security flaws, misconfigurations, and outdated software that could be exploited by attackers
-	Network Vulnerability Scanners: These tools scan networked systems and devices, such as servers, routers, and firewalls, to identify security weaknesses and misconfigurations. Example: Nessus 
-	 Web Application Vulnerability Scanners: These tools focus on identifying security flaws in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure APIs. Example: OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
  
GOVERNANCE, RISK AND COMPLIANCE TOOL:
A Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tool helps organizations efficiently manage and integrate governance, risk management, and compliance activities. It ensures that governance practices align with organizational objectives, facilitates the identification and management of risks to protect the organization, and automates compliance with laws and regulations.
-	RSA Archer: offers comprehensive risk, compliance, and audit management features
-	MetricStream: provides robust governance, risk management, compliance automation, and audit management capabilities.

SECURITY AWARENESS TOOL:
Designed to educate and train employees about cybersecurity best practices, potential threats, and safe behaviors to prevent security incidents.
-	KnowBe4: Provides interactive security awareness training and simulated phishing attacks to educate employees about cybersecurity risks and best practices
-	Cofense : Offers phishing awareness training and phishing simulation services designed to improve employee resilience against phishing attacks.

ENDPOINT DETECTIOON AND RESPONSE (EDR) TOOL
is designed to monitor, detect, and respond to suspicious activities and threats on endpoints, such as computers, servers, and mobile devices. They use advanced analytics and machine learning to identify malicious behaviors, contain threats, and enable swift remediation to protect against data breaches and other cyberattacks.
-	Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: uses artificial intelligence and cloud-powered analytics to detect and respond to advanced threats
-	CrowdStrike Falcon: leverages machine learning and behavioral analytics to detect and respond to advanced threats in real-time

SECURITY INFORMATION AND EVENT MANAGEMENT (SIEM) TOOL 
SIEM tools collect, correlate, and analyze log data from various sources within an IT infrastructure to detect potential security threats, support incident response, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
-	Splunk: Splunk is used to monitor IT environment, aggregating log data from servers, applications, and network devices to detect suspicious activities, generate alerts, and facilitate rapid investigation and response to security incidents
-	IBM QRadar : It collects and correlates data to identify security threats and vulnerabilities, helping organizations respond quickly to incidents.
